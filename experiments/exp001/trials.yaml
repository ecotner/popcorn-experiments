notes: First experiment. Purchased brand new kernels of both types. Realized that if I need to go through multiple bags in the future, the bags could be a nuisance factor, so I need to keep track of them. No lot/batch numbers on bags, so I'll label them with numbers of my own. There was so much popcorn to eat and so much of it was inedible that I was only able to finish about 75% of it in one go, and finished the rest the next morning. Getting through the end is so much of a slog I'm going to have to start raising my standards for what passes as "edible" so that I can reject kernels and get through it faster! I think I also cut my tongue on the sharp bits of the kernels, so will need to be more careful about that.

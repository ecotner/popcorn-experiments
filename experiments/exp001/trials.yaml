notes: First experiment. Purchased brand new kernels of both types. Realized that if I need to go through multiple bags in the future, the bags could be a nuisance factor, so I need to keep track of them. No lot/batch numbers on bags, so I'll label them with numbers of my own. There was so much popcorn to eat and so much of it was inedible that I was only able to finish about 75% of it in one go, and finished the rest the next morning. Getting through the end is so much of a slog I'm going to have to start raising my standards for what passes as "edible" so that I can reject kernels and get through it faster! I think I also cut my tongue on the sharp bits of the kernels, so will need to be more careful about that.

total duration: 12m0s
burn rating (*/10): 2
crispiness rating (*/10): 8
overall quality (*/10): 8
notes: Kernels hadn't popped after 7m30, so I increased the heat to 5/9; they started popping about 30s afterward. Perhaps the wire mesh lid led to too much heat loss? Either way, I will start using 5/9 as the lower level of the temperature magnitude variable from now on. The temporal distribution of individual kernel pops was very heavy-tailed, so I kept it on the stove a little longer than normal here, which may have increased burn severity. The quality of this trial was significantly better than the previous, and I suspect it is mostly due to the different brand of kernel, but need more evidence to be sure.

notes: Apparent mass of popped kernels is likely inflated because of oil added. Wonder if I can infer oil density from data by adding a term to account for it in the regression of popped mass?

notes: Noticed that the mass of the popped kernels is higher than the unpopped kernels this time; I think it's highly likely the oil is the culprit.

### Note: all data above this point was taken under a misspecified Plackett-Burman
### design. We can still use it for analysis, but I'm going to start the
### experiment over again from this point.

notes: Totally fucked up the timing measurements. Seems like a lot of the popped kernels had very dense centers, and the material was a little bit chewy.

notes: This one was burned to shit... complete failure! Looks like almost 1/2 of the kernels were unpopped too. I didn't even bother eating it. I'm pretty sure the age of these kernels is a major factor, as it has been several months since I first bought them.

notes: Absolutely fantastic. There were a couple small kernel fragments that couldn't be eaten but they were so few that they didn't even register on the scale. This brand perhaps might not be as affected by age as the other one?

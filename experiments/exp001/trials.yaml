overall quality (*/10): 5
notes: First experiment. Purchased brand new kernels of both types. Realized that if I need to go through multiple bags in the future, the bags could be a nuisance factor, so I need to keep track of them. No lot/batch numbers on bags, so I'll label them with numbers of my own. There was so much popcorn to eat and so much of it was inedible that I was only able to finish about 75% of it in one go, and finished the rest the next morning. Getting through the end is so much of a slog I'm going to have to start raising my standards for what passes as "edible" so that I can reject kernels and get through it faster! I think I also cut my tongue on the sharp bits of the kernels, so will need to be more careful about that.

kernel mass (g): 56
popped mass (g): 50
popped volume (cup): 5.16
inedible mass (g): 7
inedible volume (cup): 0.125
time to first pop: 8m44s
total duration: 12m0s
burn rating (*/10): 2
crispiness rating (*/10): 8
overall quality (*/10): 8
notes: Kernels hadn't popped after 7m30, so I increased the heat to 5/9; they started popping about 30s afterward. Perhaps the wire mesh lid led to too much heat loss? Either way, I will start using 5/9 as the lower level of the temperature magnitude variable from now on. The temporal distribution of individual kernel pops was very heavy-tailed, so I kept it on the stove a little longer than normal here, which may have increased burn severity. The quality of this trial was significantly better than the previous, and I suspect it is mostly due to the different brand of kernel, but need more evidence to be sure.

notes: Apparent mass of popped kernels is likely inflated because of oil added. Wonder if I can infer oil density from data by adding a term to account for it in the regression of popped mass?

notes: Noticed that the mass of the popped kernels is higher than the unpopped kernels this time; I think it's highly likely the oil is the culprit.

### Note: all data above this point was taken under a misspecified Plackett-Burman
### design. We can still use it for analysis, but I'm going to start the
### experiment over again from this point.
